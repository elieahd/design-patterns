# Design patterns

## What is a design pattern ?
 Reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design.
 
 It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code.
 
 Rather, it is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.
 
 Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.
